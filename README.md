# Budget Planner 
**Budget Planner** is a beginner-friendly Java program designed to practice variables, expressions, and assignment statements. It simulates a real-life budgeting scenario for a grader/TA at the College of Computing and Informatics (CCI), helping determine how many hours they need to work to afford living expenses. 

## Project Overview 
This project was developed as in a Computer Science course at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. It introduces basic programming concepts such as: 
- Variable declarations
- Arithmetic expressions
- Console output
- Basic code design using psuedocode or flowcharts

## Program Functionality 
- **Total Monthly Expenses**
  - Rent: $625
  - Internet: $27
  - Groceries: $250
  - Fun Allowance: $150
- **Output Includes**
  - Total monthly expense breakdown
  -  Weekly hours needed to break even
  -  Weekly hours needed to save $100/month

## Reflection 
This project served as an introductory programming milestone, reinforcing key fundamentals in Java. It also provided insight into planning and structuring a program before writing code. Challenges encountered were mostly around organizing calculations and rounding output accurately, which were resolved through iterative testing and step-by-step debugging.
